        <p> Legos are really cool! Building them is my favorite hobby. I like building them because when they are done, they look awesome! I built the Taj Mahal lego which looks really cool. Another reason is that I can play with the minifigueres when ready. With the minifigures, I can play and take them to diffrent places inside the Lego set. The last reason why I love building legos is because they help me with my concentration. If you don't have focus while building, everything will go wrong. So as you can see, I love building Legos! You should give a try in Legos and see the outcome.
